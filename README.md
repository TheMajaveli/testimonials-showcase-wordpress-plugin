   - `Customer Photo` (Type: Image)
5. Configure the `Location` rules to display this field group when the Post Type is `Testimonial`.

### Adding Testimonials

2. Click 'Add New' and enter the testimonial details using the ACF fields.
3. Upload the customer's photo using the 'Customer Photo' field.

The plugin will automatically display these fields in the slider.
